Accurate heart disease prediction can significantly enhance the quality of life for patients as heart disease is a major illness 
and cause of death worldwide. Clinical evaluations and medical histories, which can be arbitrary and prone to inaccuracy are the 
mainstays of conventional approaches for predicting heart disease. Machine learning algorithms have recently demonstrated 
potential in accurately predicting heart disease based on patient's health data. In this study, we used a collection of patient 
data to examine the degree to which five well-known machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest,
k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machine algorithms) could correctly predict the presence of heart disease. The dataset 
obtained from the blackboard and it includes patient’s demographical, clinical, and physiological data, several preprocessing 
steps were applied to make the dataset suitable for machine learning algorithms. The performance metrics such as; accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score of each algorithm were evaluated and compared with each other. We were able to determine that the 
Support Vector Machine Algorithm was the most accurate and dependable for predicting heart disease, which can help guide clinical 
judgement and improve patient’s treatment. The result was saved as a dot pkl file for future use.
